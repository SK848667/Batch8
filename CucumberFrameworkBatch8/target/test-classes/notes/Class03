Hooks vs Background

Hooks are implemented for all the features across your project (hooks apply for all the scenarios)
and they are based on annotations @Before and @After

Background is implemented for the specific scenario. It is used to define a step
or series of steps which are common to all the tests inside your feature file.


Data Driven Test DDT in Cucumber can be  performed in 2 ways:
1)Scenario Outline with Examples

Scenario vs Scenario Outline:
Scenario will run the steps only once and finish the execution

Scenario Outline will run all the steps same number of time depending on how many
sets of data you have stored inside Examples. Examples is a must for scenario outline

2)Datatable
? will run your specific step multiple time (it will run)




HW Search for employee
5 sets of data for searching by id
5sets of data searching by name

use background, and scenario outline
