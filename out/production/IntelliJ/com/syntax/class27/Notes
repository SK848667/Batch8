Main OOPS concept in java:
1)Inheritance
2)Polymorphism
3)Abstraction
4)Encapsulation
1)Inheritance:
is a mechanism to refer functions and fields of parent class  to subclasses
It is a process where on class acquires the properties and methods of
another class.
2)Polymorphism:
the ability of the object to take many forms
being able to do multiple functions using same reference variable but with different
objects
process when object can perform actions in different way
There are two types of Polymorphism runtime/dynamic late binding and compile time
early binding or static
we can achieve compile time polymorphism using method overloading
we can achieve dynamic or runtime binding using method overriding.
3)Abstraction
abstraction is a process of showing the functionality
to the user but hiding the processes or implementation details behind it
To implement Abstraction abstract.

If we have declared a class as abstract we can not create objects of that
class
